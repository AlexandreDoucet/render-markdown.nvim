# TODOs

- See if there is a stable way to align table cells according to delimiter
  alignment info.
- Add a performance test suite to measure improvements, relative value on
  same hardware should still be useful.
- Look into showing marks when switching buffers, currently remains hidden
- Figure out how to display the many configuration options & impact
